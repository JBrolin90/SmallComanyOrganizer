This is a VBA project for Microsoft Access. Its a helper solution for small domestic service companies. Currently localized for the Swedish market.
I am using RubberDuckVBA for this project.

This solution makes use of a sql server database
You need to provide a a public constant connectionString that points to your database.
There is a script to create the database in the databaseScript folder.
